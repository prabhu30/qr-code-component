## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learnt how to use CSS grid to center content, max-width property to limit the product of card and how to use variables to color text and background colors of components.

### Continued development

I am planning to include this component in full page & end-to-end websites, so that way i would understand what changes have to be made to the design for better visual experience.
